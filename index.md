# Ruby Monstas

Ruby Monstas stands for *(Berlin) Ruby Monday Study Group'stas*, and this is
our homepage.

We are one of many project groups in the [Berlin Rails Girls](http://railsgirlsberlin.de)
community, some of which [can be found here](https://rorganize.it/).

We meet every **Monday at 7pm** at the [Ganz oben office](/location.html) (the
office on the very top floor).

If you identify as a woman, and want to learn programming Ruby, learn how to
build a web application, or are otherwise interested in joining or supporting
any of our groups, then feel free to come by, or get in touch via
[email](mailto:ruby.monsters@gmail.com).

Please feel invited to come visit, **no matter what level** you are on, or what
previous experience with programming or technology you have. There are people
on all kinds of levels, ranging from beginners with no previous experience to
quite advanced members who now work in developer positions:

**Everyone is welcome. Please join us.**

At the moment there are around 20 people joining on a normal Monday, splitting
up into 4-5 groups, supported by 5-6 coaches.

* Our beginners groups study the [basics of programming in Ruby](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org).
* The next level groups learn the [basics of building a web application](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org).
* Advanced intermediate groups build their Rails application as a shared learning project.
* More advanced groups maintain previously started projects (see below) and continue learning more advanced topics.
* A frontend group focusses on implementing HTML and CSS for the [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) project.
* There also used to be a [Clojure group](http://cljart.github.io/) that has split into a separate group in the meanwhile.

Advanced students may coach beginners group, generally help with questions, or
simply focus on learning advanced topics, and maintain their projects.

People like to bring snacks that will be shared during the breaks.

We have close ties to the amazing [Rubycorns](http://rubycorns.club) (Lisa
coaches our frontend group), other Rails Girls study groups in
[Berlin](https://rorganize.it/groups?utf8=%E2%9C%93&city=Berlin), as well
as the [Rails Girls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/) community.
