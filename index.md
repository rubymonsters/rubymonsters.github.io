# Ruby Monstas

Ruby Monstas stands for *(Berlin) Ruby Monday Study Group'stas*, and this is
our homepage.

We are one of many project groups in the [Berlin Rails Girls](http://railsgirlsberlin.de)
community, some of which [can be found here](http://railsgirlsapp.shellyapp.com).

We meet every **Monday at 7pm** at the [Ganz oben office](/location.html) (the office on the very top floor).

If you identify as a woman, and want to learn programming Ruby, learn how to
build a web application, or are otherwise interested in joining or supporting
any of our groups, then feel free to come by, or get in touch via
[email](mailto:ruby.monsters@gmail.com).

At the moment there are around 20 people joining on a normal Monday, splitting
up into 4 groups, and supported by 5 coaches:

* A beginners group, learning the [basics of programming in Ruby](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org);
* An intermediate group, building their first web application as a shared
  learning project;
* An advanced group, maintaining [Speakerinnen](https://www.speakerinnen.org)
  and learning about more advanced topics;
* A [Clojure group](http://cljart.github.io/), mixed skills levels.


People like to bring snacks which will be shared during the breaks.
