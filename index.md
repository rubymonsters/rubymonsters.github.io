# Ruby Monstas

Ruby Monstas stands for *(Berlin) Ruby Monday Study Group'stas*, and this is
our homepage.

We are one of many project groups in the [Berlin Rails Girls](http://railsgirlsberlin.de)
community, some of which [can be found here](http://railsgirlsapp.shellyapp.com).

We meet every **Monday at 7pm** at the [Ganz oben office](/location.html) (the
office on the very top floor).

If you identify as a woman, and want to learn programming Ruby, learn how to
build a web application, or are otherwise interested in joining or supporting
any of our groups, then feel free to come by, or get in touch via
[email](mailto:ruby.monsters@gmail.com).

Please feel invited to come visit, **no matter what level** you are on, or what
previous experience with programming or technology you have. There are people
on all kinds of levels, ranging from beginners with no previous experience to
quite advanced members who now work in developer positions:

**Everyone is welcome. Please join us.**

At the moment there are around 20 people joining on a normal Monday, splitting
up into 4 groups, and supported by 5 coaches:

* A beginners group, learning the [basics of programming in Ruby](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org);
* An intermediate group, learning the [basics of building a web application](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org);
* An advanced intermediate group, building their first web application as a shared
  learning project;
* A more advanced group, maintaining [Speakerinnen](https://www.speakerinnen.org)
  and learning about more advanced topics;
* A [Clojure group](http://cljart.github.io/), mixed skills levels.


People like to bring snacks which will be shared during the breaks.
