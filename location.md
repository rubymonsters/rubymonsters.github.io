# Where we meet

We meet at the Travis CI office in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain. The address is [Rigaer Straße 8](https://goo.gl/maps/EXECJQQB5qs), a short walk from both the tram at [M10 Bersarinplatz](https://citymapper.com/trip/Tnor7s8) and the U-Bahn at [U5 Frankfurter Tor](https://citymapper.com/trip/Tkwvroe).

We are next door to the Galiläakirche (Galilee Church). Find the door marked number 8 and ring the doorbell marked "Tessa". We'll buzz you in. Inside, take the staircase on the left and go up to the top floor.
